> :soon: We are working to create a small webpage to display the results extracted from the conference data obtained with the crawler.

# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data

**This directory contains data from 10 conferences extracted with the crawler we have created.**

> :warning: It is important to note that the data shown here has been modified afterward, as the crawler cannot obtain all the information from some conferences. To have the most complete data possible, additional information has been added after the crawling process.

These data may also contain fields that are not extracted by the crawler. This is because the crawler has been modified over time, and some fields that were extracted but not used have been removed in the current version of the crawler (with some minor modifications to the crawler, this can be changed).
